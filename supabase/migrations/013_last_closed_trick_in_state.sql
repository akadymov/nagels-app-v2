-- Add last_closed_trick to get_room_state output.
--
-- The client's <GameTableScreen> reads snapshot.last_closed_trick to keep
-- the just-completed trick visible on the table for ~1.5 s — long enough
-- for everyone to see the final 4th card and who took it. Until this
-- migration the SQL never returned the field, so trickHoldUntil never
-- triggered: as soon as a player played the 4th card the table jumped
-- straight to the next (empty) trick, hiding the decisive card.
--
-- This is the key fix for the "after the last card is played, the table
-- doesn't update for everyone — it jumps straight to the new empty
-- trick" report. The client logic for the hold already exists; it just
-- had no data to act on.
